- 🌱 I’m currently learning anything related in technology except the mobile client app s**** ...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate by throwing hands against people who will critisize our f****** project without our consent (ง ͠ಥ_ಥ)ง ...
- 📫 How to reach me ... Don't reach me... [I will be here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxIRb3LEs8A) when you least expected ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ...
